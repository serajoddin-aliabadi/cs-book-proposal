## Step 5. Inheritance

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.
  
### Study Items

 1. [C# book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-c-12/9781098158354/), chapter 6 : Inheritance
 2. [Covariant and Contravariant (Dot Philosophy)](https://mehrandvd.com/2016/06/18/covariant-and-contravariant/) 
 3. [Differences between generics in C# and Java and Templates in C++](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31693/what-are-the-differences-between-generics-in-c-sharp-and-java-and-templates-i)

### Tasks

 1. Reach **50 reputation** on Stack Overflow, then achieve the **[Commentator](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/31/commentator)** badge.  
 2. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to lesson 285.
 3. Pass these exercises at exercism.io:
    - Tournament
 4. Project: Animal Hierarchy with Covariance and Contravariance<br>
    Project Description:
    - In this mini-project, you'll build an animal hierarchy system to deepen your understanding of inheritance, polymorphism, covariance, and contravariance in C#.
    - You'll start by creating a base `Animal` class with common properties like Name and Age, along with methods such as `Eat()`, `Sleep()`, and `MakeSound()`. 
    - Then, you'll create derived classes like `Mammal`, `Bird`, and `Fish`, each with additional properties and behaviors.
    - Specific animals like `Dog`, `Eagle`, and `Shark` will further extend these classes, overriding methods to provide specialized behavior.
    - Youâ€™ll also implement generic interfaces to demonstrate covariance and contravariance, allowing different animal types to be managed in a flexible and type-safe way.
 6. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your coordinator to schedule a live presentation session for you on your deadline day.
 7. Hold your step presentation on LinkedIn. Guidelines on how to present are provided on [this page](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/blob/master/courses/presentation-guidelines.md).
 8.	It's time to be a mentor. Ask your mentor to start your onboarding process for mentorship.
